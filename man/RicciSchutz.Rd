\title{Ricci and Schutz index}
\usage{
RicciSchutz(X, W = rep(1, length(X)), na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{is a data vector}

\item{W}{is a vector of weights}

\item{na.rm}{logical, should missing values (NAs) be removed prior to computations? If set to FALSE the computations yield NA}
}
\value{
The value of Ricci and Schutz coefficient.
}
\description{
Computes Ricci and Schutz inequality measure of a given variable taking into account weights.
}
\details{
In the case of an empirical distribution with n elements where y_{i} denotes the wealth of household i and \eqn{\overline{y}} the sample average, the Ricci and Schutz coefficient can be expressed as:
\deqn{RS =  \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\mid y_{i} - \overline{y} \mid}{\overline{y}}}
}
\examples{
# Compare weighted and unweighted result.
X=1:10
W=1:10
RicciSchutz(X)
RicciSchutz(X,W)

data(Tourism)
#Ricci and Schutz index for Total expenditure with sample weights:
X= Tourism$`Total expenditure`
W=Tourism$`Sample weight`
RicciSchutz(X,W)
